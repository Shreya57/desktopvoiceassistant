# Desktop Voice Assistant
## About

Humans always wish to reduce their burden by automating processes or by completing tasks with minimal efforts and interaction and that is just why, almost all tasks are digitalized today. The Desktop Voice Assistant (DVA) is an apt solution to facilitate digitalization. Virtual voice assistants can tremendously save your time, but most voice assistants available today offer very minimal functionalities.

The DVA provides personalized assistance to individuals and acts as a helping hand in their daily chores. It communicates with a user just as a human does. It takes input in the form of voice, processes it and returns the output in forms like voice and action. It is designed to be used specifically on desktops/laptops.

This project draws inspiration from existing virtual assistants like Cortana and Siri with a motivation to improvise and add new commands. It thus aims to develop a virtual voice assistant for the Windows operating system with maximum functionalities and
overcoming some of the possible drawbacks of the already existing voice assistants. Presently, the system has been developed as an automation tool and virtual assistant.

It automates various services using single line commands. It eases most of the user's tasks like searching on the web, retrieving weather forecast, sending mails, sending WhatsApp messages and many more.
